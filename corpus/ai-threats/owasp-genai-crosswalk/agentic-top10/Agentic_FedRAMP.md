# Agentic Top 10 2026 × FedRAMP AI Overlay

Mapping the [OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI 2026](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-top-10-for-agentic-applications-for-2026/)
to the [FedRAMP AI Overlay](https://www.fedramp.gov/) extending
[NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final)
with AI-specific control enhancements.

FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program) is the US
government's standardised approach to security authorisation for cloud
services. The AI overlay extends FedRAMP baseline controls with
AI-specific requirements. For agentic AI deployments — where autonomous
agents invoke tools, persist memory across sessions, and orchestrate
multi-agent workflows — the FedRAMP AI overlay provides critical guidance
on securing the expanded attack surface introduced by tool usage, delegated
authority, chained automation, and shared context stores within the federal
authorisation boundary. Organisations deploying agentic AI in FedRAMP
environments must address non-human identity management, agent privilege
controls, cascading automation risk, and supply chain integrity for agent
components.

---

## Why FedRAMP for agentic security

Agentic capability is arriving inside cloud services that already hold a
federal authorisation, which makes the practical question a narrow one:
which 800-53 controls does an autonomous agent touch, and does adding one
constitute a significant change to the boundary?

The control families that carry agentic risk are identifiable and mostly
about identity and containment. **AC-2**, **AC-3**, and **AC-6** cover
account management, access enforcement, and least privilege for agent
identities — the single largest lever on agentic blast radius. **CM-7**
least functionality bounds what tools an agent can reach at all. **SI-4**
system monitoring covers behavioural detection. **AU-2** through **AU-12**
cover the audit record that makes agent action attributable and
reconstructable. **SC-7** boundary protection governs egress from the agent's
execution environment. **SR** family controls cover the provenance of agent
components and tool descriptors. **IR** family controls cover response,
where agentic systems need containment primitives conventional playbooks
lack.

Expressing agentic controls in 800-53 identifiers rather than AI-specific
vocabulary lets an existing System Security Plan absorb agents as control
implementation statements, which is considerably easier to get through
assessment than a new appendix.

Use this file to scope a significant change request, to draft SSP narratives
for agent components, and to brief a 3PAO on the boundary implications of
autonomy.

### ASI01 – Agent Goal Hijacking

**Severity:** Critical

Adversaries manipulate agent goals through direct or indirect prompt
injection, context manipulation, or tool output poisoning, causing the
agent to pursue attacker-defined objectives while appearing to function
normally. FedRAMP AI overlay addresses this through malicious code
protection extended to adversarial agent inputs (SI-3), input validation
for agent prompts and context (SI-10), penetration testing covering agent
hijacking (CA-8), and logging of all agent actions (AU-2).

**Real-world references:**

### ASI02 – Misconfigured Access Controls

**Severity:** High

Agent systems deployed with overly permissive access to tools, data stores,
APIs, or other agents enable unintended actions and data exposure. FedRAMP
AI overlay addresses this through access enforcement on agent resources
(AC-3), least privilege for agent permissions (AC-6), least functionality
restricting agent capabilities (CM-7), and audit logging of access
decisions (AU-2).

#### FedRAMP AI mapping

| Control | ID | Family | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

| Least Privilege — agent permissions | AC-6 | AC | Enforce least privilege for all agent permissions; restrict tool access, data store access, and API scope to minimum necessary per agent role |
| Least Functionality — agent capability restrictions | CM-7 | CM | Restrict agents to minimum necessary capabilities; disable unused tools, APIs, and action types; enforce capability restrictions in agent configuration |
| Event Logging — access decision logging | AU-2 | AU | Log all agent access decisions — permitted and denied — with sufficient detail for access control review and incident investigation |

#### Mitigations

**Foundational**

- AC-6: Define explicit least privilege policies for each agent; document
  maximum permitted tool access, data store access, and API scope
- AC-3: Implement role-based access control on all agent resources;
  deny access by default; require explicit grants

  patterns for over-privileging indicators
- AC-3: Implement just-in-time access for agent tool invocations;
  grant access only for the duration of the specific task

### ASI03 – Privilege Escalation

**Severity:** Critical

Agents exploit misconfigured permissions, tool chaining, or inter-agent
trust to escalate privileges beyond intended scope — accessing sensitive
data, invoking restricted tools, or taking administrative actions. FedRAMP
AI overlay addresses this through least privilege enforcement (AC-6),
non-human identity authentication for agents (IA-2), access enforcement
at tool boundaries (AC-3), and incident handling for escalation events (IR-4).

#### FedRAMP AI mapping

| Control | ID | Family | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Least Privilege — escalation prevention | AC-6 | AC | Enforce least privilege with explicit privilege ceilings per agent; prevent accumulation of permissions through tool chaining or inter-agent delegation |
| Identification and Authentication — agent NHI | IA-2 | IA | Assign unique non-human identities to each AI agent; authenticate agent identity at each tool invocation and inter-agent communication boundary |
| Access Enforcement — tool boundary enforcement | AC-3 | AC | Enforce access control at every tool invocation boundary; validate agent identity and authorisation for each requested action regardless of calling context |
| Incident Handling — escalation incident response | IR-4 | IR | Define incident handling procedures for agent privilege escalation events; include automated containment, privilege revocation, and forensic investigation |

#### Mitigations

**Foundational**

- AC-6: Define explicit privilege ceilings per agent; prevent privilege
  accumulation through chained operations or delegated authority
- IA-2: Assign unique non-human identities to each agent; authenticate
  at every tool invocation and inter-agent boundary
- AC-3: Enforce access control at each tool boundary independently;
  never inherit permissions from calling agent context

**Hardening**

- IR-4: Define automated containment procedures for detected privilege
  escalation; include privilege revocation and session termination
- AC-6: Implement privilege decay; agent permissions expire after
  defined duration and must be re-authorised
- IA-2: Implement mutual authentication between agents in multi-agent
  workflows; verify identity at each delegation point

**Advanced**

- AC-3: Deploy formal access control verification; prove that no
  sequence of tool invocations can exceed the defined privilege ceiling
- IR-4: Conduct tabletop exercises for agent privilege escalation
  scenarios; test containment and response procedures
- IA-2: Implement attestation-based agent identity with hardware-backed
  credentials where feasible

### ASI04 – Supply Chain Compromise

**Severity:** High

Agentic AI systems depend on third-party tools, plugins, MCP servers,
model weights, and agent frameworks — any of which can be compromised.
FedRAMP AI overlay addresses this through supply chain planning (SR-2),
supply chain controls and provenance verification (SR-3), external
services controls for third-party agent components (SA-9), and secure
development lifecycle for agent systems (SA-3).

#### FedRAMP AI mapping

| Control | ID | Family | Description |

### ASI05 – Uncontrolled Code Execution

**Severity:** Critical

Agents with code execution capabilities run attacker-influenced code —
through prompt injection, tool output manipulation, or supply chain
compromise — leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or lateral
movement. FedRAMP AI overlay addresses this through least functionality
restricting code execution (CM-7), boundary protection for execution
sandboxes (SC-7), malicious code protection for agent-generated code
(SI-3), and penetration testing of execution boundaries (CA-8).

#### FedRAMP AI mapping

### ASI06 – Memory Poisoning & Context Confusion

**Severity:** High

Adversaries manipulate agent memory stores, context windows, or shared
state to influence future agent decisions. FedRAMP AI overlay addresses
this through protection of information at rest for memory stores (SC-28),
malicious code protection extended to adversarial memory manipulation
(SI-3), audit logging of memory operations (AU-2), and vulnerability
scanning covering memory infrastructure (RA-5).

#### FedRAMP AI mapping

| Control | ID | Family | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

### ASI07 – Lateral Tool Chaining

**Severity:** High

Agents exploit tool chaining to combine individually safe operations into
harmful sequences — exfiltrating data, modifying systems, or escalating
privileges through multi-step workflows. FedRAMP AI overlay addresses
this through least privilege on tool access (AC-6), least functionality
restricting tool combinations (CM-7), access enforcement at each tool
boundary (AC-3), and comprehensive tool invocation logging (AU-2).

#### FedRAMP AI mapping

### ASI08 – Cascading Automation & Failure

**Severity:** High

Failures or attacks in one agent propagate through interconnected multi-agent
systems causing cascading disruptions, amplified damage, or system-wide
compromise. FedRAMP AI overlay addresses this through boundary protection

### ASI09 – Emerging Agentic Patterns

**Severity:** Medium

Novel agentic architectures — multi-agent orchestration, tool-use planning,
self-reflection loops, and autonomous goal decomposition — introduce
security risks not yet fully characterised. FedRAMP AI overlay addresses

### ASI10 – AI Agent Dependency Failures

**Severity:** Medium

Agents depend on external services — model APIs, tool endpoints, data
sources, and inter-agent communication — whose failure or degradation
causes agent malfunction, incorrect outputs, or service disruption.
FedRAMP AI overlay addresses this through supply chain planning for agent
dependencies (SR-2), external service controls (SA-9), system monitoring
for dependency health (SI-4), and incident handling for dependency
failures (IR-4).

#### FedRAMP AI mapping

| Control | ID | Family | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Supply Chain Risk Management Plan — agent dependencies | SR-2 | SR | Include all agent external dependencies — model APIs, tool endpoints, data sources — in supply chain risk management with availability and integrity requirements |
| External Information System Services — agent service dependencies | SA-9 | SA | Require SLAs from agent dependency providers covering availability, performance, security, and incident notification; establish fallback procedures |
| System Monitoring — dependency health monitoring | SI-4 | SI | Monitor agent dependency health in real time — API availability, response latency, error rates; alert on degradation and trigger fallback procedures |
| Incident Handling — dependency failure response | IR-4 | IR | Define incident handling procedures for agent dependency failures; include automated fallback activation, graceful degradation, and service restoration |

#### Mitigations

**Foundational**

- SR-2: Document all agent external dependencies in the supply chain
  plan; assess availability and single-point-of-failure risk
- SA-9: Establish SLAs with dependency providers covering availability,
  performance, and incident notification
- SI-4: Monitor dependency health; alert on availability and
  performance degradation

**Hardening**

- IR-4: Define and test automated fallback procedures for dependency
  failures; include graceful degradation and safe-state transitions
- SA-9: Identify critical agent dependencies; require redundant
  providers for critical services
- SI-4: Include dependency failure scenarios in monitoring; test
  detection and alerting capabilities

**Advanced**

- SR-2: Conduct dependency failure impact analysis; quantify the
  blast radius of each dependency failure on agent system functionality
- IR-4: Include dependency failure in FedRAMP contingency testing;
  verify fallback procedures under realistic conditions
- SA-9: Include dependency provider security posture in FedRAMP
  continuous monitoring
