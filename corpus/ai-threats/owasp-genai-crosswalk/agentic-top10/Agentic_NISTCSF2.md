# Agentic Top 10 2026 × NIST CSF 2.0

Mapping the [OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications 2026](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-top-10-for-agentic-applications-for-2026/)
to the [NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework).

The new GOVERN function in CSF 2.0 is especially relevant for agentic
AI — autonomous systems require explicit governance policies around
acceptable autonomy scope, human oversight requirements, and supply
chain management that the old CSF 1.1 had no category for. Every
agentic deployment should map its autonomy policy to GV.OC-01 and
GV.RM-01 before any technical controls are designed.

---

## Why NIST CSF 2.0 for agentic security

CSF 2.0 is the framework most enterprise security programmes are already
organised around, and its 2.0 revision added exactly the function agentic
risk needs most. **GOVERN** — new in 2.0 — covers risk strategy, roles,
policy, and oversight, which is where the decisions that actually determine
agentic risk get made: how much autonomy an agent gets, who owns it, and
what it may do unsupervised.

The remaining functions extend to agents without much strain, but the
emphasis shifts. **IDENTIFY** has to inventory agents, their tools, their
credentials, and their memory stores as assets in their own right — an
untracked agent with a standing token is the agentic equivalent of shadow
IT. **PROTECT** concentrates on identity and access management, because an
agent's permission envelope is the real control surface. **DETECT** has to
cover behavioural deviation over time, not just point-in-time anomalies.
**RESPOND** and **RECOVER** need containment primitives that conventional
incident response lacks: quarantining an agent, revoking its credentials
mid-task, and rolling back actions it already took.

That last point is where most programmes are weakest. Response playbooks
written for compromised accounts and hosts do not cover an autonomous
process that is still executing.

Use this file to fold agentic systems into an existing CSF profile, and
alongside `Agentic_NISTAIRMF.md` for the AI-specific risk process.

### ASI01 — Agent Goal Hijack

**Severity:** Critical

An attacker redirects agent objectives through instruction injection.
CSF 2.0 GOVERN provides the policy anchor — without GV.OC-01 defining
acceptable agent behaviour, every other control lacks a reference point.

#### CSF 2.0 mapping

| Category | ID | Function | How it applies |
|---|---|---|---|
| Organisational Context | GV.OC-01 | GOVERN | Policy defines permissible agent autonomy — agents cannot change stated goals without human confirmation |
| Platform Security | PR.PS-04 | PROTECT | Secure software development — input validation and goal-state verification as platform security controls |
| Continuous Monitoring | DE.CM-01 | DETECT | Networks and assets monitored — injection indicators detected across all agent input channels |
| Incident Mitigation | RS.MI-01 | RESPOND | Incidents contained — agent suspended, actions reversed, kill switch activated |

#### Mitigations by CSF function

**GOVERN**

- GV.OC-01: Establish and document policy on permissible
  agent autonomy — what goal changes require human
  confirmation, what actions agents cannot take autonomously
- GV.RM-06: Include agent goal hijack in risk register —
  document per-deployment blast radius, owner, treatment

**IDENTIFY**

- ID.RA-01: Map all injection paths per deployment in
  risk assessment — user prompt, RAG, tool returns,
  email, documents, web content

**PROTECT**

- PR.PS-04: Implement goal-state verification and input
  validation as platform security requirements — structural
  controls enforced at the orchestration layer
- Treat all external content as untrusted regardless of
  source channel

**DETECT**

- DE.CM-01: Monitor all agent input channels for injection
  indicators — real-time detection, not periodic review

**RESPOND**

- RS.MI-01: Define containment procedure for goal hijack —
  kill switch activation, action reversal checklist,
  downstream impact assessment

| Continuous Monitoring | DE.CM-01 | DETECT | All tool invocations logged and monitored — anomalous parameters, unusual sequences, high frequency detected |
| Incident Analysis | RS.AN-03 | RESPOND | Root cause analysis — which tool was misused, what downstream impact occurred, what parameters were used |

#### Mitigations by CSF function

**GOVERN**

- GV.OC-01: Define tool use policy — approved tools per
  agent role, operations requiring human confirmation,
  prohibited tool operations documented

**PROTECT**

- PR.AA-05: Implement per-tool permission manifests —
  each tool scoped to minimum required operations,
  enforced at the orchestration layer

  tool identity, parameters, user session, timestamp,
  anomalous patterns alerted

**RESPOND**

- RS.AN-03: Investigate tool misuse incidents — what
  parameters were generated, what downstream state
  was changed, what can be reversed

  short-lived JIT issuance
- PR.DS-01: Store all agent credentials encrypted —
  secret manager, no cleartext in config or logs

**DETECT**

- DE.CM-01: Monitor agent credential usage — anomalous
  access scope, unusual timing, cross-system lateral
  movement detected

**RESPOND**

- RS.MI-01: Contain credential exposure — immediate

**GOVERN**

- GV.OC-01: Policy requires AI disclosure in all
  agent-user interactions — EU AI Act Art. 50 compliance
  as a governance requirement, not just legal obligation

**PROTECT**

- PR.AT-01: Train all users of agent decision-support
