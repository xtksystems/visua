# LLM Top 10 2026 × NIST AI RMF

Mapping the [OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2026](https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/)
to the
[NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.100-1.pdf)
and its companion [NIST AI RMF Playbook](https://airc.nist.gov/AI_RMF_Knowledge_Base/Playbook).

The NIST AI RMF is the primary governance framework for trustworthy AI
in the United States and is widely adopted globally by enterprises,
government agencies, and critical infrastructure operators. It organises
AI risk management across four core functions — GOVERN, MAP, MEASURE,
MANAGE — each with subcategories that map directly to LLM security controls.
US federal agencies are required to align with the AI RMF under Executive
Order 14110. It is the foundational framework for enterprise AI governance
programmes and pairs directly with NIST CSF 2.0 for organisations already
using the cybersecurity framework.

---

## Why NIST AI RMF for LLM security

The AI Risk Management Framework is the reference US federal agencies,
their contractors, and a large share of the US private sector use to
structure AI risk work. It is voluntary and outcome-based rather than
prescriptive, which is exactly why it needs a crosswalk: it tells you what
outcome to achieve, not which control achieves it for an LLM application.

Its four functions divide the work cleanly. **GOVERN** establishes policy,
accountability, and risk tolerance. **MAP** establishes context — what the
system does, who it affects, and which risks apply. **MEASURE** covers
testing, evaluation, and metrics. **MANAGE** covers treatment, monitoring,
and response. Each LLM entry in this file is mapped across all four, so a
single vulnerability shows its governance, contextual, measurement, and
treatment obligations together.

The framework pairs with the Generative AI Profile (NIST AI 600-1), which
enumerates GenAI-specific risks against the same four functions. Where an
LLM Top 10 entry has a direct 600-1 counterpart, the mapping notes it.

Use this file to build an AI risk register, to structure an AI governance
programme, or to evidence AI risk management to a federal customer. It is
the natural companion to `LLM_NISTCSF2.md` for organisations already running
a CSF-aligned security programme.

## Detailed mappings

### LLM01 — Prompt Injection

**Severity:** Critical

Malicious instructions in user input or processed content manipulate
LLM behaviour, bypassing safety controls and executing unauthorised
actions. The NIST AI RMF addresses this primarily through governance
of input handling policies, risk measurement of adversarial inputs,
and managed response to injection incidents.

The 2026 entry extends prompt injection to cross-modal payloads.
Instructions hidden in an image, an audio track, or a video frame reach the
model without ever being human-readable, and steganographic or
invisible-Unicode carriers survive review of the rendered interface.

**Real-world references:**

- EchoLeak (2025) — Microsoft 365 Copilot turned into silent
  exfiltration engine via indirect prompt injection
- Samsung source code leak (2023) — proprietary code surfaced
  through manipulated model queries

### LLM02 — Sensitive Information Disclosure

**Severity:** High

LLMs expose PII, financial data, proprietary code, or confidential
information through outputs — from training data memorisation,
over-permissive RAG retrieval, or improperly sanitised responses.
The AI RMF addresses this through data governance policies, privacy
risk measurement, and managed data protection controls.

**Real-world references:**

- Samsung source code leak (2023)
- Multiple healthcare LLM deployments surfacing PHI through
  over-permissive RAG retrieval (2024)

### LLM03 — Excessive Agency

**Severity:** Critical

LLMs granted excessive autonomy over tools, APIs, and systems execute
unintended or harmful actions when manipulated. The AI RMF addresses
this through governance of AI decision authority, human oversight
requirements, and managed response to autonomous action incidents.

#### NIST AI RMF mapping

| Subcategory | ID | Function | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Policies for trustworthy AI | GV-1.7 | GOVERN | Organisational policy defines and enforces limits on AI system autonomy and decision authority |
| Risk categorisation | MP-2.3 | MAP | Excessive agency risks mapped to specific tool and API integrations in the risk register |
| Testing — adversarial | MS-2.5 | MEASURE | Autonomy boundary testing included in adversarial evaluation programme |
| Risk response | MG-2.2 | MANAGE | Defined response for unauthorised autonomous actions including rollback and notification |

#### Mitigations by tier

  evaluation — verify that the model cannot exceed its defined
  permission scope even under adversarial input
- MG-2.2: Establish automated response to detected unauthorised
  autonomous actions — session isolation, owner notification,
  action rollback where feasible
- Log all tool invocations with full parameter capture — feed into
  AI risk monitoring programme

**Advanced**

- GV-1.7: Include AI autonomy limits in board-level AI governance
  reporting — autonomous action scope changes require executive
  sign-off
- MS-2.5: Conduct red team exercises specifically targeting
  excessive agency through indirect prompt injection
- Formally specify permitted action graphs — only pre-approved
  action sequences can execute in production

### LLM04 — Supply Chain

**Severity:** High

LLM applications depend on third-party model weights, datasets,
libraries, and plugins — any of which can be compromised to introduce
backdoors or malicious functionality. The AI RMF addresses this through
supply chain risk governance, dependency mapping, and third-party
risk management.

The 2026 entry adds artifact provenance to this scope. A promoted
model, adapter, or converted artifact that is not what it claims to be —
unsigned weights, a hijacked conversion or merge service, or namespace reuse
on a model hub — is a supply-chain compromise even when every package
dependency is clean.

#### NIST AI RMF mapping

| Subcategory | ID | Function | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Policies for data privacy | GV-1.6 | GOVERN | Supply chain data governance — policies for third-party model and data provenance |

| Testing and evaluation | MS-2.5 | MEASURE | Evaluation programme includes supply chain component integrity testing |
| Residual risk — third party | MG-3.2 | MANAGE | Residual risk from third-party components documented, monitored, and treated |

  programme — verify signatures, scan for backdoors, validate
  provenance before each deployment
- MG-3.2: Document and treat residual risk from all third-party
  components — include in AI risk register with review cadence
- Implement automated SBOM generation and drift detection — alert
  on any unplanned component change

**Advanced**

### LLM05 — Data and Model Poisoning

**Severity:** Critical

Attackers corrupt training data or fine-tuning pipelines to embed
backdoors or bias model behaviour in ways baked into the weights and
invisible to standard testing. The AI RMF addresses this as a core
data quality and adversarial evaluation requirement.

The 2026 entry folds in fine-tuning subversion. A supplier LoRA
adapter, a customer fine-tune, or a distilled checkpoint can carry a backdoor
that no pre-training control catches, so poisoning defences must cover every
stage that writes weights, not just the original training corpus.

**Real-world references:**

- Nightshade (2023) — poison pixels successfully corrupted image
  generation model behaviour
- Adversarial examples achieving 35% influence on model outputs
  despite defensive mechanisms

#### NIST AI RMF mapping

  specific treatment controls assigned to training pipeline owners
- Implement source allowlisting for training data — only approved,
  validated sources enter training pipelines

  programme — test for backdoor triggers and biased outputs on each
  model version before promotion
- MG-2.2: Establish model rollback capability — versioned model
  registry with ability to revert to a known-clean checkpoint on
  poisoning detection
- Apply differential privacy during training to limit the influence
  of any single training example

**Advanced**

### LLM06 — Unbounded Consumption

**Severity:** High

Adversarial inputs trigger disproportionate resource consumption —
CPU, memory, tokens, API costs — causing denial of service or
runaway cost. The AI RMF addresses this through operational
resilience governance, resource limit measurement, and managed
response to availability incidents.

#### NIST AI RMF mapping

| Subcategory | ID | Function | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Testing — adversarial | MS-2.5 | MEASURE | Resource exhaustion and denial-of-service scenarios included in adversarial testing |
| Risk response | MG-2.2 | MANAGE | Defined response to detected unbounded consumption events including rate limiting activation |
| Residual risk — availability | MG-3.2 | MANAGE | Residual availability risk from resource exhaustion documented and treated |

### LLM07 — Misinformation

**Severity:** High

LLMs generate plausible but factually incorrect content that users
or downstream systems act upon. The AI RMF addresses this through
accuracy measurement requirements, feedback mechanisms, and
governance of AI-generated content quality.

### LLM08 — Hidden Context Exposure

**Severity:** High

Hidden context — the system prompt, developer instructions, retrieved
policy text, and the tool and function schemas an application assembles
into the model's context window — is extracted, inferred, or
reconstructed by adversaries.
The AI RMF addresses this through
confidentiality policies, configuration security testing, and
managed disclosure response.

The 2026 list broadens the former System Prompt Leakage entry to cover all
non-user-facing context, not just the system prompt. Severity tracks what
that context holds: internal rules and workflow logic are medium, embedded
credentials or reliance on context secrecy for authorisation are high, and
disclosure that chains to code execution or broad exfiltration is critical.
Design on the assumption that hidden context is discoverable, and never
treat it as a security boundary.

#### NIST AI RMF mapping

| Subcategory | ID | Function | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Policies for data privacy | GV-1.6 | GOVERN | System prompts classified as sensitive configuration — subject to data governance policy |
| Testing — data leakage | MS-2.6 | MEASURE | Prompt extraction scenarios included in evaluation programme |
| Risk response — data | MG-2.4 | MANAGE | Defined response for detected hidden context exposure |

#### Mitigations by tier

**Foundational**

- GV-1.6: Classify system prompts as sensitive configuration
  artefacts — version controlled, access controlled, and reviewed
  on every change
- Never embed credentials, API keys, or sensitive data in system
  prompts — use environment variables and secret managers, enforced
  by policy
- MP-2.3: Include hidden context exposure in AI risk register with
  specific extraction scenario testing assigned

**Hardening**

- MS-2.6: Include prompt extraction scenarios in your evaluation
  programme — test against your specific deployment before go-live
  and after each system prompt change

### LLM09 — Vector and Embedding Weaknesses

**Severity:** Medium

Weaknesses in embedding stores enable adversarial retrieval
manipulation, inference of sensitive information from embeddings,
and semantic search poisoning. The AI RMF addresses this through
data quality measurement and adversarial evaluation of retrieval
systems.

  AI risk register

**Hardening**

- Implement anomaly detection on vector store ingestion and
  query patterns

**Advanced**

- MS-2.5: Conduct embedding inversion red team exercises to
  validate that your embeddings do not reconstruct source content
- Apply differential privacy in embedding generation for sensitive

### LLM10 — Improper Output Handling

**Severity:** High

LLM-generated output passed to downstream components without
validation enables XSS, command injection, SSRF, or SQL injection
via AI-generated content. The AI RMF addresses this through output
evaluation requirements and managed response to output-related incidents.

The 2026 entry renames Insecure Output Handling to Improper Output
Handling and widens it to cover the insecure code that coding assistants
generate at scale. Output that reaches a compiler, a repository, or a
production system carries the same downstream-execution risk as output that
reaches a shell, a browser, or a database.

#### NIST AI RMF mapping

| Subcategory | ID | Function | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Testing — output safety | MS-2.5 | MEASURE | Output handling security included in AI evaluation and testing programme |
| Testing — data leakage | MS-2.6 | MEASURE | Output leakage and injection scenarios covered in evaluation |
| Risk response | MG-2.2 | MANAGE | Incident response for output handling failures defined and tested |
| Policies for trustworthy AI | GV-1.7 | GOVERN | Organisational policy requires secure output handling for all LLM integrations |

#### Mitigations by tier

**Foundational**

- GV-1.7: Establish policy requiring all LLM outputs to be treated
  as untrusted input by downstream systems — encoding, validation,
  and sanitisation mandatory before rendering or execution
- MS-2.5: Include output injection scenarios in your AI evaluation
  programme — XSS, SQL injection, command injection via LLM output
- Never pass raw LLM output directly to database queries, shell
  commands, or eval functions — policy enforced at code review

**Hardening**

- MS-2.6: Test output sanitisation effectiveness as part of
  every release evaluation — not just at initial deployment
- MG-2.2: Define incident response for output injection events —
  what is isolated, how is impact assessed, what is user notification
- Implement output schema validation — define and enforce the
  structure of acceptable model responses per integration point

**Advanced**

- MS-2.5: Conduct DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) on
  all interfaces that consume LLM output — include in CI/CD pipeline
- Deploy dedicated output security layer between LLM and all
  downstream consumers, independent of the model
- GV-1.7: Include output security requirements in AI procurement
  standards — vendors must demonstrate output handling controls

## AI RMF profiles

The NIST AI RMF supports the creation of AI risk profiles —
current state vs target state assessments. For LLM deployments,
a starter profile mapping all 10 OWASP entries to AI RMF subcategories
is available at:
`data/llm-top10/nist-aiRMF-profile.json`

This can be used directly in AI RMF-aligned governance programmes
and compliance assessments.
