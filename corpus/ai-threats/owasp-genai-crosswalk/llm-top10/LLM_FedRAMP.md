# LLM Top 10 2026 × FedRAMP AI Overlay

Mapping the [OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2026](https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/)
to the [FedRAMP AI Overlay](https://www.fedramp.gov/) extending
[NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final)
with AI-specific control enhancements.

FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program) is the US
government's standardised approach to security authorisation for cloud
services. The AI overlay extends FedRAMP baseline controls with
AI-specific requirements addressing model access, inference logging,
adversarial testing, model versioning, AI agent identity, AI incident
handling, and AI supply chain risk. Federal agencies deploying
cloud-hosted AI services must meet FedRAMP AI overlay requirements in
addition to the standard baseline. This mapping enables organisations to
trace each OWASP LLM Top 10 risk to specific FedRAMP AI controls and
implement them within their authorisation boundary.

## Why FedRAMP for LLM security

FedRAMP is the authorisation path for any cloud service sold to a US federal
agency, and LLM features are arriving inside services that already hold an
authorisation. That creates an immediate, concrete question: does adding a
model to an authorised system change its security posture enough to require
reassessment, and which controls does it touch?

This file answers that in NIST SP 800-53 terms, the control language a
FedRAMP package is actually written in. The mappings concentrate on the
families where LLM risk lands — **SI** system and information integrity for
input validation, output filtering, and malicious code protection; **AC**
access enforcement and least privilege; **SC** system and communications
protection for data at rest and boundary protection; **AU** audit and
accountability for inference logging; **SR** supply chain risk management
for model and dataset provenance; **CM** configuration management and least
functionality; **RA** and **CA** for scanning, assessment, and penetration
testing.

Working in 800-53 identifiers rather than AI-specific vocabulary is
deliberate. It lets an existing System Security Plan absorb AI components as
control implementation statements rather than as an appendix nobody
inherits.

Use this file to scope a significant change request, to draft SSP control
narratives for AI components, and to brief a 3PAO on what the model changes
about an existing boundary.

### LLM01 — Prompt Injection

**Severity:** Critical

Malicious instructions embedded in user inputs or external content manipulate
LLM behaviour, bypassing safety controls and executing unauthorised actions.
FedRAMP AI overlay addresses this through malicious code protection extended
to adversarial AI inputs (SI-3), input validation for prompt content (SI-10),
vulnerability scanning including AI red-teaming (RA-5), and penetration
testing covering prompt injection vectors (CA-8).

The 2026 entry extends prompt injection to cross-modal payloads.
Instructions hidden in an image, an audio track, or a video frame reach the
model without ever being human-readable, and steganographic or
invisible-Unicode carriers survive review of the rendered interface.

**Real-world references:**

- EchoLeak (2025) – indirect prompt injection turned Microsoft 365 Copilot
  into a silent exfiltration engine via email content
- Samsung source code leak (2023) – proprietary data surfaced through
  manipulated model queries

#### FedRAMP AI mapping

| Control | ID | Family | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Malicious Code Protection — adversarial AI inputs | SI-3 | SI | Extend malicious code protection to detect and block adversarial inputs including direct and indirect prompt injection payloads |
| Information Input Validation — prompt validation | SI-10 | SI | Validate all inputs to LLM inference endpoints; enforce structural separation between instruction and data contexts; reject known injection patterns |
| Vulnerability Scanning — AI red-teaming | RA-5 | RA | Include prompt injection vectors in vulnerability scanning programme; conduct regular automated and manual injection testing |
| Penetration Testing — AI adversarial testing | CA-8 | CA | Include prompt injection scenarios in penetration testing engagements; cover direct, indirect, and multimodal injection paths |

#### Mitigations

**Foundational**

- SI-10: Implement input validation on all LLM-facing endpoints —
  enforce structural separation between system instructions and user
  content; reject inputs matching known injection signatures
- SI-3: Extend malicious input detection to cover adversarial prompt
  patterns; deploy input scanning as a pre-processing layer before
  model inference
- Establish a policy that all LLM inputs from untrusted sources are
  treated as potentially adversarial; enforce at architecture review

**Hardening**

- CA-8: Include prompt injection in penetration testing scope — cover
  direct injection, indirect injection via RAG sources, jailbreak
  patterns, and multimodal vectors; gate production releases on
  penetration test sign-off
- RA-5: Deploy automated prompt injection scanning tools in CI/CD;
  run against each model version before deployment
- Apply privilege separation — if the model cannot invoke destructive
  tools by design, injection impact is bounded

**Advanced**

- CA-8: Extend adversarial testing to cover your specific RAG document
  corpus, tool descriptors, MCP server schemas, and any email or
  calendar processing pipelines
- SI-3: Integrate injection detection signals into your SIEM and
  FedRAMP continuous monitoring programme; automate session isolation
  on high-confidence injection indicators
- RA-5: Document red-team findings as POA&M items; track remediation
  through the FedRAMP authorisation lifecycle

### LLM02 — Sensitive Information Disclosure

**Severity:** High

LLMs inadvertently reveal sensitive data — PII, credentials, proprietary
content, or system architecture details — through model responses. FedRAMP
AI overlay addresses this through protection of information at rest including
training data and model weights (SC-28), comprehensive AI decision and
inference logging (AU-2), and access enforcement on model endpoints and
training data stores (AC-3).

#### FedRAMP AI mapping

| Control | ID | Family | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Protection of Information at Rest — training data and model weights | SC-28 | SC | Encrypt training data, fine-tuning datasets, and model weights at rest; prevent data memorisation exposure through access controls on data stores |
| Event Logging — AI inference logging | AU-2 | AU | Log all model inference requests and responses with sufficient detail to detect sensitive data disclosure; include user identity, query content, and response metadata |
| Access Enforcement — model endpoint access | AC-3 | AC | Enforce role-based access control on model inference endpoints; restrict access to training data, fine-tuning data, and model configuration based on clearance and need-to-know |
| System Monitoring — output content monitoring | SI-4 | SI | Monitor model outputs for sensitive data patterns — PII, credentials, classification markings — and alert on detection |

#### Mitigations

**Foundational**

- SC-28: Encrypt all training data, fine-tuning datasets, and model
  weights at rest using FIPS 140-validated cryptographic modules;
  enforce key management aligned with FedRAMP requirements
- AC-3: Implement role-based access control on all model inference
  endpoints; ensure that only authorised users and services can query
  the model; restrict training data access to approved ML engineers
- AU-2: Log all inference requests and responses with user identity,
  timestamp, and query metadata; retain logs per FedRAMP retention
  requirements

**Hardening**

- SI-4: Deploy output monitoring to detect sensitive data patterns in
  model responses — PII, credentials, API keys, classification
  markings; alert and block on detection
- SC-28: Conduct data memorisation testing on models before deployment;
  verify that training data cannot be extracted through targeted queries
- AU-2: Feed inference logs into your FedRAMP continuous monitoring
  programme; establish alerting for anomalous query patterns

**Advanced**

- Apply differential privacy to training pipelines to bound memorisation
  risk; measure and track privacy budget
- Deploy output classifiers that detect and redact sensitive content
  before responses reach end users
- SC-28: Include data extraction testing in FedRAMP annual assessments;
  document residual memorisation risk in SSP

### LLM03 — Excessive Agency

**Severity:** Critical

LLMs granted excessive autonomy over tools, APIs, and systems execute
unintended or harmful actions when manipulated. FedRAMP AI overlay addresses
this through least privilege enforcement for AI agent permissions (AC-6),
least functionality restricting AI capabilities (CM-7), access enforcement
on tool invocations (AC-3), and risk management strategy covering AI
autonomy risk (PM-9).

#### FedRAMP AI mapping

| Control | ID | Family | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Least Privilege — AI agent permissions | AC-6 | AC | Enforce least privilege for all AI agent tool access, API permissions, and autonomous action scope; restrict to minimum capabilities needed per deployment |
| Least Functionality — AI capability restrictions | CM-7 | CM | Restrict AI systems to minimum necessary capabilities; disable unused tools, APIs, and action types; enforce capability restrictions in configuration |
| Access Enforcement — tool invocation control | AC-3 | AC | Enforce access control on all AI tool invocations; require authorisation for each tool call based on agent identity, context, and action type |
| Risk Management Strategy — AI autonomy risk | PM-9 | PM | Include AI autonomy and excessive agency in the organisational risk management strategy; define acceptable autonomy thresholds and escalation procedures |

#### Mitigations

**Foundational**

- AC-6: Define explicit least privilege policies for each AI deployment;
  document the maximum permitted tool access, API scope, and autonomous
  action types; enforce before go-live
- CM-7: Disable all AI capabilities and tool access not explicitly
  required; maintain a tool permission manifest per deployment
- AC-3: Require human approval for all irreversible or high-impact
  actions; enforce in architecture, not relying on model judgment

**Hardening**

- PM-9: Include AI autonomy risk in organisational risk assessment;
  define acceptable autonomy thresholds tied to data sensitivity and
  impact level within the FedRAMP authorisation boundary
- AC-6: Log all tool invocations with full parameter capture; feed
  into runtime anomaly detection and FedRAMP continuous monitoring
- CM-7: Review tool permission manifests at each FedRAMP annual
  assessment; remove unused permissions

**Advanced**

- Conduct formal adversarial exercises specifically testing indirect
  injection through every data source that feeds the agent; permission
  manifest must hold under worst-case injection
- AC-6: Include AI autonomy limits in security design reviews;
  autonomous action scope changes require explicit security sign-off
- Formally specify permitted action graphs; only pre-approved action
  sequences can execute in production

### LLM04 — Supply Chain

**Severity:** High

LLM applications depend on third-party model weights, datasets, libraries,
and plugins — any of which can be compromised to introduce backdoors or
malicious functionality. FedRAMP AI overlay addresses this through supply
chain planning (SR-2), supply chain controls and provenance verification
(SR-3), external information system services controls for third-party AI
providers (SA-9), and secure system development lifecycle for AI (SA-3).

The 2026 entry adds artifact provenance to this scope. A promoted
model, adapter, or converted artifact that is not what it claims to be —
unsigned weights, a hijacked conversion or merge service, or namespace reuse
on a model hub — is a supply-chain compromise even when every package
dependency is clean.

#### FedRAMP AI mapping

| Control | ID | Family | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Supply Chain Risk Management Plan — AI components | SR-2 | SR | Include all AI components — models, datasets, adapters, libraries, plugins — in the supply chain risk management plan with provenance and risk assessment |
| Supply Chain Controls — model provenance verification | SR-3 | SR | Implement integrity verification for all AI supply chain components using cryptographic signatures, checksums, and attestation before deployment |
| External Information System Services — third-party AI | SA-9 | SA | Require third-party AI service providers to meet FedRAMP requirements; establish SLAs covering model security, data handling, and incident notification |
| System Development Life Cycle — AI SDLC | SA-3 | SA | Integrate AI-specific security activities into the SDLC — model security review, adversarial testing, supply chain verification at each lifecycle phase |

#### Mitigations

**Foundational**

- SR-2: Establish an approved sources policy for AI components; model
  weights, datasets, adapters, and libraries must come from vetted
  sources with documented provenance
- SR-3: Verify cryptographic signatures or checksums for all model
  artefacts before deployment; do not deploy unsigned or unverified
  components
- Maintain a complete ML SBOM for every production AI system within
  the FedRAMP authorisation boundary

**Hardening**

- SA-9: Require FedRAMP authorisation or equivalent for all third-party
  AI service providers; include AI-specific security requirements in
  service agreements
- SA-3: Integrate model security review and adversarial testing into
  your SDLC; gate production deployment on security sign-off
- SR-3: Implement automated supply chain integrity verification in
  CI/CD; block deployment on verification failure

**Advanced**

- SR-2: Conduct backdoor detection on all new model versions from
  third-party providers before production promotion
- SA-9: Include third-party AI provider security posture in FedRAMP
  continuous monitoring; reassess annually or on significant change
- Extend ML SBOM to cover runtime dynamic components — MCP servers,
  plugins, and tools fetched at inference time

### LLM05 — Data and Model Poisoning

**Severity:** Critical

Attackers corrupt training data or fine-tuning pipelines to embed backdoors
or bias model behaviour in ways baked into the weights and invisible to
standard inference testing. FedRAMP AI overlay addresses this through supply
chain risk management planning covering AI data sources (SR-2), supply chain
controls for model provenance (SR-3), adversarial input protection for
training pipelines (SI-3), and configuration change control for model
updates (CM-3).

The 2026 entry folds in fine-tuning subversion. A supplier LoRA
adapter, a customer fine-tune, or a distilled checkpoint can carry a backdoor
that no pre-training control catches, so poisoning defences must cover every
stage that writes weights, not just the original training corpus.

**Real-world references:**

- Nightshade (2023) – poison pixels successfully corrupted image generation
  model behaviour at scale
- BadNets (academic) – backdoor triggers embedded through poisoned training
  labels, activating only on specific inputs in production

#### FedRAMP AI mapping

| Control | ID | Family | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Supply Chain Risk Management Plan — AI data sources | SR-2 | SR | Include AI training data sources, fine-tuning datasets, and pre-trained model weights in the supply chain risk management plan; document provenance and risk assessment for each |
| Supply Chain Controls and Processes — model provenance | SR-3 | SR | Implement supply chain controls for AI model components — verify integrity, provenance, and authenticity of all training data and model weights before use |
| Malicious Code Protection — training pipeline integrity | SI-3 | SI | Extend malicious code protection to training data pipelines; detect and block poisoned data, anomalous labels, and backdoor triggers |
| Configuration Change Control — model update governance | CM-3 | CM | Require formal change control for all model updates, fine-tuning runs, and training data changes; maintain audit trail of all modifications |

#### Mitigations

**Foundational**

- SR-2: Include all AI training data sources in your supply chain risk
  management plan; document data provenance, licensing, and risk
  assessment for each source
- SR-3: Implement integrity verification for all training data and
  model weights — cryptographic checksums, signed attestations, and
  provenance documentation
- CM-3: Require formal change control for all model retraining and
  fine-tuning activities; log all training runs with dataset references

**Hardening**

- SI-3: Apply anomaly detection to training data before each training
  run — flag statistical outliers, unexpected label distributions, and
  content inconsistent with the source domain
- SR-3: Maintain a secure model registry with signed checksums for
  every model version; implement rollback capability to pre-poisoning
  checkpoints on detection
- CM-3: Implement automated validation gates in the training pipeline;
  block promotion of models trained on unvetted data

**Advanced**

- Apply differential privacy during training to bound the influence of
  any single training example — measure and track privacy budget
- SI-3: Conduct backdoor detection (neural cleanse or equivalent) on
  all new model versions trained on external datasets before promotion
  to production
- SR-2: Conduct ongoing monitoring of training data supply chain;
  re-assess risk on schedule aligned with FedRAMP continuous monitoring

### LLM06 — Unbounded Consumption

**Severity:** High

Unrestricted resource usage — compute, memory, tokens, API costs — causes
denial of service or runaway cost. FedRAMP AI overlay addresses this through
boundary protection with rate limiting and cost controls (SC-7), system
monitoring for consumption anomalies (SI-4), and least functionality
restricting resource access (CM-7).

#### FedRAMP AI mapping

| Control | ID | Family | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Boundary Protection — rate limiting and cost controls | SC-7 | SC | Enforce rate limiting, token quotas, and cost circuit breakers at the AI service boundary; define per-user and per-session consumption limits |
| System Monitoring — consumption anomaly detection | SI-4 | SI | Monitor AI service consumption metrics — tokens, latency, cost — in real time; alert and auto-mitigate on consumption anomalies |
| Least Functionality — resource budget enforcement | CM-7 | CM | Restrict AI services to defined resource budgets; disable unnecessary model capabilities; enforce compute and cost limits in configuration |
| Incident Handling — consumption incident response | IR-4 | IR | Define incident handling procedures for AI consumption anomalies including automatic throttling, service suspension, and cost cap enforcement |

#### Mitigations

**Foundational**

- SC-7: Define per-user token limits, per-session rate limits, maximum
  context window size, and monthly cost budgets as explicit boundary
  controls; enforce at the API gateway
- CM-7: Restrict AI inference services to minimum necessary resource
  budgets; disable unused endpoints and capabilities
- SI-4: Monitor consumption metrics and establish baseline usage
  patterns; alert on deviations

**Hardening**

- SC-7: Deploy cost circuit breakers that automatically suspend service
  when consumption exceeds thresholds; implement per-tenant cost budgets
  with automatic suspension on breach
- SI-4: Include consumption anomaly detection in FedRAMP continuous
  monitoring; test detection against adversarial consumption patterns
- IR-4: Define and test automated response to consumption incidents;
  exercise procedures quarterly

**Advanced**

- Conduct adversarial cost-maximisation testing to identify maximum-cost
  input patterns; apply additional controls at those paths
- Implement adaptive rate limiting with real-time system load awareness;
  thresholds adjust dynamically under sustained attack
- Document AI service RTO and RPO in FedRAMP contingency plan; include
  consumption incidents in tabletop exercises

### LLM07 — Misinformation

**Severity:** High

LLMs generate factually incorrect, misleading, or fabricated content
(hallucinations) that users or downstream systems treat as authoritative.
FedRAMP AI overlay addresses this through system monitoring for output
quality (SI-4), continuous monitoring for model drift (CA-7), and audit
review of AI behaviour and outputs (AU-6).

#### FedRAMP AI mapping

| Control | ID | Family | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| System Monitoring — output quality monitoring | SI-4 | SI | Monitor model outputs for factual accuracy, consistency, and hallucination indicators; alert when confidence scores or factual grounding drops below thresholds |
| Continuous Monitoring — model drift detection | CA-7 | CA | Include model output quality and drift monitoring in FedRAMP continuous monitoring programme; track accuracy metrics, hallucination rates, and output consistency over time |
| Audit Review — AI behaviour review | AU-6 | AU | Regularly review AI inference logs and output samples for hallucination patterns, factual errors, and misleading content; escalate findings through security channels |
| Information Input Validation — grounding and retrieval validation | SI-10 | SI | Validate retrieval sources and grounding data provided to the model; ensure factual grounding sources are authoritative and current |

#### Mitigations

**Foundational**

- SI-4: Monitor model outputs for hallucination indicators — factual
  inconsistencies, unsupported claims, and fabricated references;
  establish baseline accuracy metrics
- CA-7: Include model output quality metrics in FedRAMP continuous
  monitoring; track accuracy, hallucination rate, and factual
  grounding over time
- AU-6: Conduct regular reviews of AI inference logs for hallucination
  patterns; escalate findings to model governance

**Hardening**

  document hallucination risk and mitigations in SSP
- AU-6: Implement automated hallucination detection in continuous
  monitoring; integrate with incident response for high-impact contexts

### LLM08 — Hidden Context Exposure

**Severity:** High

Hidden context — the system prompt, developer instructions, retrieved
policy text, and the tool and function schemas an application assembles
into the model's context window — is extracted, inferred, or
reconstructed by adversaries.
FedRAMP AI overlay addresses this through protection of
information at rest covering system prompt confidentiality (SC-28), access
enforcement on prompt configuration (AC-3), and inference logging to detect
extraction attempts (AU-2).

The 2026 list broadens the former System Prompt Leakage entry to cover all
non-user-facing context, not just the system prompt. Severity tracks what
that context holds: internal rules and workflow logic are medium, embedded
credentials or reliance on context secrecy for authorisation are high, and
disclosure that chains to code execution or broad exfiltration is critical.
Design on the assumption that hidden context is discoverable, and never
treat it as a security boundary.

#### FedRAMP AI mapping

| Control | ID | Family | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Protection of Information at Rest — system prompt confidentiality | SC-28 | SC | Classify system prompts as sensitive configuration; encrypt at rest, enforce access controls, and apply version control and audit logging to all prompt stores |
| Access Enforcement — prompt configuration access | AC-3 | AC | Restrict access to system prompt configurations to authorised personnel; enforce role-based access control and change management on all prompt modifications |
| Event Logging — prompt extraction detection | AU-2 | AU | Log inference interactions with sufficient detail to detect system prompt extraction attempts; alert on query patterns indicative of extraction techniques |
| Malicious Code Protection — prompt extraction defence | SI-3 | SI | Deploy output monitoring to detect and block responses containing system prompt content; treat extraction as a security event |

#### Mitigations

**Foundational**

- SC-28: Classify system prompts as sensitive configuration artefacts;
  encrypt at rest using FIPS 140-validated modules; version control
  with access logging on all modifications
- AC-3: Restrict access to system prompt configurations to authorised
  personnel only; enforce least privilege and change management
- AU-2: Log all inference requests with sufficient detail to detect

### LLM09 — Vector and Embedding Weaknesses

**Severity:** Medium

Vulnerabilities in vector databases and embedding pipelines enable data
poisoning, unauthorised access to embedding stores, or extraction of
sensitive information from vector representations. FedRAMP AI overlay
addresses this through protection of information at rest for embedding
stores (SC-28), malicious code protection extended to adversarial embedding
manipulation (SI-3), and vulnerability scanning covering embedding
infrastructure (RA-5).

#### FedRAMP AI mapping

| Control | ID | Family | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Protection of Information at Rest — embedding store protection | SC-28 | SC | Encrypt vector databases and embedding stores at rest; enforce access controls and audit logging on all embedding read and write operations |
| Malicious Code Protection — adversarial embedding detection | SI-3 | SI | Extend malicious code protection to detect adversarial manipulation of embeddings — poisoned vectors, out-of-distribution injections, and embedding inversion attacks |
| Vulnerability Scanning — embedding infrastructure | RA-5 | RA | Include vector databases, embedding pipelines, and retrieval infrastructure in vulnerability scanning; test for injection, access control bypass, and data extraction |
| Access Enforcement — embedding store access | AC-3 | AC | Enforce role-based access control on vector database operations; restrict who can read, write, and delete embeddings |

#### Mitigations

**Foundational**

- SC-28: Encrypt all vector databases and embedding stores at rest;
  implement access controls restricting read/write access to authorised
  services and personnel
- SI-3: Validate all content before embedding generation; reject
  content that fails integrity or provenance checks
- RA-5: Include embedding infrastructure in your vulnerability scanning
  programme; scan for known CVEs in vector database software

**Hardening**

- AC-3: Implement tenant isolation in multi-tenant vector databases;
  enforce access control at the namespace or collection level
- SI-3: Deploy anomaly detection on embedding writes — flag vectors
  that are statistical outliers or inconsistent with the source domain
- RA-5: Conduct embedding inversion testing to assess whether
  sensitive source content can be reconstructed from stored embeddings

**Advanced**

- SC-28: Include vector database security in FedRAMP annual assessments;
  document embedding store architecture in SSP
- Deploy embedding watermarking to detect tampering and verify provenance
  of stored vectors
- SI-3: Implement continuous monitoring of embedding store integrity;
  alert on unexpected bulk modifications or access pattern anomalies

### LLM10 — Improper Output Handling

**Severity:** High

Model output is passed to a downstream consumer — a browser, a shell, a
database, or another service — without validation, encoding, or escaping,
turning a generated string into executed code or an injected query. The
FedRAMP AI overlay addresses this through information input validation
applied at the consuming boundary (SI-10), information output filtering on
model responses (SI-15), least functionality on the components that consume
that output (CM-7), and audit logging of output crossing into privileged
systems (AU-2).

The 2026 entry renames Insecure Output Handling to Improper Output
Handling and widens it to cover the insecure code that coding assistants
generate at scale. Output that reaches a compiler, a repository, or a
production system carries the same downstream-execution risk as output that
reaches a shell, a browser, or a database.

**Real-world references:**

- Markdown image-URL exfiltration (2023–2025) — unescaped model output
  rendered by a chat client silently sent conversation data to an
  attacker-controlled host
- LLM-to-SQL agents issuing destructive statements against production
  databases when generated queries were executed without parameterisation

#### FedRAMP AI mapping

| Control | ID | Family | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Information Input Validation — output as downstream input | SI-10 | SI | Validate model output at every consuming boundary; the consumer treats generated content as untrusted input and applies syntactic and schema validation before acting on it |
| Information Output Filtering — model response filtering | SI-15 | SI | Filter and encode model responses before release to a renderer, interpreter, or downstream service; reject content that fails the boundary content-type policy |
| Least Functionality — output consumer hardening | CM-7 | CM | Remove interpreter, shell, and dynamic-evaluation paths from components that consume model output; disable any capability the consumer does not require |
| Audit Events — output boundary logging | AU-2 | AU | Log model output crossing into privileged systems, including the payload, the consuming component, and the validation verdict, for incident reconstruction |
| Access Enforcement — downstream privilege limits | AC-3 | AC | Enforce least-privilege service accounts on every consumer of model output so unvalidated content cannot reach a high-privilege operation |

#### Mitigations

**Foundational**

- SI-10: Apply context-appropriate encoding at every output boundary —
  HTML-escape for browsers, parameterised statements for databases,
  argument arrays rather than shell strings for process invocation
- SI-15: Constrain output to a validated schema wherever the consumer
  expects structured data; reject rather than coerce on validation failure
- CM-7: Remove dynamic-evaluation, dynamic-import, and shell-interpolation
  paths from any component that consumes model output

**Hardening**

- AC-3: Run downstream execution of generated content under a dedicated
  low-privilege service account with no standing credentials
- AU-2: Log the full output payload at each boundary crossing into a
  privileged system; feed the boundary validation verdict into continuous
  monitoring per CA-7
- SI-15: Sandbox rendering and execution of generated content with no
  network egress to authorisation-boundary systems

**Advanced**

- CA-8: Include output-handling exploitation in penetration testing —
  XSS, SQL injection, command injection, and insecure generated code paths
  chained from prompt injection
- SI-10: Enforce allowlisted output content types at the gateway so an
  unrecognised type never reaches a rendering or execution sink
- CM-7: Gate assistant-generated code entering a repository behind the same
  review and SAST controls as any other change
