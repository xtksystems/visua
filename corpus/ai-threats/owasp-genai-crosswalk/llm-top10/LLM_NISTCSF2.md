# LLM Top 10 2026 × NIST CSF 2.0

Mapping the [OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2026](https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/)
to the [NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)
(CSF 2.0), published February 2024.

## Why CSF 2.0 for LLM security

CSF 2.0 is the most widely adopted cybersecurity framework globally —
used by governments, critical infrastructure operators, and enterprises
across sectors. Three changes in CSF 2.0 make it significantly more
relevant for LLM security than CSF 1.1:

**GOVERN function (new in 2.0):** CSF 2.0 adds a sixth function —
GOVERN — explicitly covering cybersecurity risk management strategy,
supply chain risk, and organisational roles. LLM governance, acceptable
use policy, and AI vendor management all map directly to GOVERN.

**Supply chain elevation:** Supply chain risk management (GV.SC) is now
a dedicated category. LLM model providers, dataset vendors, and plugin
ecosystems are third-party technology suppliers under CSF 2.0 GV.SC.

**Continuous improvement emphasis:** CSF 2.0 strengthens the feedback
loop between IDENTIFY, DETECT, RESPOND, and RECOVER — critical for LLM
systems where the threat surface evolves faster than traditional IT.

### LLM01 — Prompt Injection

**Severity:** Critical

Malicious instructions in user input or processed content manipulate
LLM behaviour. CSF 2.0 addresses this through platform security
(PROTECT), continuous monitoring (DETECT), and risk assessment (IDENTIFY).

The 2026 entry extends prompt injection to cross-modal payloads.
Instructions hidden in an image, an audio track, or a video frame reach the
model without ever being human-readable, and steganographic or
invisible-Unicode carriers survive review of the rendered interface.

#### CSF 2.0 mapping

| Category | ID | Function | How it applies |
|---|---|---|---|
| Platform Security | PR.PS-04 | PROTECT | Secure software development practices applied to LLM integrations — input validation as a platform security control |
| Continuous Monitoring | DE.CM-01 | DETECT | Networks and assets monitored for anomalies — LLM input channels monitored for injection indicators |
| Risk Assessment | ID.RA-01 | IDENTIFY | Vulnerabilities in assets identified and documented — prompt injection as a documented vulnerability class for all LLM deployments |
| Organisational Context | GV.OC-01 | GOVERN | Mission and stakeholder expectations inform cybersecurity risk decisions — acceptable LLM use scope defines injection risk surface |

#### Mitigations by CSF function

**GOVERN**

- GV.OC-01: Define acceptable use policy for LLM applications —
  specify which input channels are permitted, what content is
  trusted, and what constitutes an injection attempt
- GV.RM-06: Include prompt injection in enterprise risk register —

**IDENTIFY**

- ID.RA-01: Document prompt injection as a vulnerability in every
  LLM asset's risk assessment — include indirect injection via
  RAG, tool returns, and processed documents
- ID.AM-08: Inventory all LLM systems and their input channels —
  unknown input surfaces cannot be protected

**PROTECT**

- PR.PS-04: Implement input validation as a platform security
  control — treat all external content as untrusted before
  entering LLM context
- Deploy architectural separation between system prompt and
  user input — structural control, not policy only

**DETECT**

- DE.CM-01: Monitor LLM input channels for injection indicators —
  anomalous inputs detected and alerted in real time
- DE.AE-02: Analyse detected events to understand attack targets —
  injection attempts correlated across sessions

**RESPOND**

- RS.AN-03: Analyse incidents to determine root cause —
  injection incidents investigated, IOCs documented
- RS.MI-01: Contain injection incidents — session termination,
  downstream action review

### LLM02 — Sensitive Information Disclosure

**Severity:** High

LLMs expose PII, financial data, or confidential information through
outputs. CSF 2.0 data security (PR.DS) and continuous monitoring
(DE.CM) are the primary categories.

#### CSF 2.0 mapping

| Category | ID | Function | How it applies |
|---|---|---|---|
| Data Security | PR.DS-01 | PROTECT | Data-at-rest protected — training data, embeddings, RAG stores containing sensitive information encrypted |
| Data Security | PR.DS-02 | PROTECT | Data-in-transit protected — all LLM API calls and RAG retrieval paths encrypted |
| Continuous Monitoring | DE.CM-01 | DETECT | LLM output channels monitored for sensitive data patterns — DLP coverage |
| Risk Management Strategy | GV.RM-06 | GOVERN | Risk tolerance established — acceptable levels of sensitive data disclosure risk defined per use case |

#### Mitigations by CSF function

**GOVERN**

- GV.RM-06: Establish risk tolerance for sensitive data disclosure
  per LLM use case — what classifications are permitted in LLM
  scope and what controls are required

**IDENTIFY**

- ID.AM-08: Inventory all data assets accessible by LLM systems —
  training data, RAG sources, embedding stores, prompt caches
- ID.RA-03: Identify threats to sensitive data via LLM exposure —
  memorisation, over-retrieval, output reconstruction

**PROTECT**

- PR.DS-01: Encrypt all sensitive data at rest in LLM scope —
  embedding stores, training datasets, RAG document stores,
  prompt caches
- PR.DS-02: Encrypt all LLM data flows in transit —
  TLS 1.2 minimum on all API calls and RAG retrieval
- PR.AA-05: Implement access controls on RAG data sources —
  least-privilege retrieval aligned with user authorisation

**DETECT**

- DE.CM-01: Deploy DLP on all LLM output channels —
  PII and sensitive patterns detected before delivery

**RESPOND**

- RS.AN-03: Investigate sensitive data disclosure incidents —

### LLM03 — Excessive Agency

**Severity:** Critical

LLMs with excessive autonomy over tools execute unintended or harmful
actions. CSF 2.0 identity management (PR.AA) and organisational
context (GV.OC) are the primary categories.

#### CSF 2.0 mapping

| Category | ID | Function | How it applies |
|---|---|---|---|
| Identity Management, Authentication & Access Control | PR.AA-05 | PROTECT | Access permissions managed — LLM tool access managed as privileged access with least privilege enforcement |
| Identity Management, Authentication & Access Control | PR.AA-01 | PROTECT | Identities managed — LLM service identities inventoried and managed, tool permissions scoped per identity |
| Continuous Monitoring | DE.CM-01 | DETECT | Networks and assets monitored — all LLM tool invocations logged and monitored for anomalous scope |
| Organisational Context | GV.OC-01 | GOVERN | Acceptable use of LLM autonomous actions defined — policy specifies what actions require human confirmation |

#### Mitigations by CSF function

**GOVERN**

- GV.OC-01: Define acceptable scope for LLM autonomous
  actions — which tool operations are permitted without
  human confirmation, which are prohibited autonomously
- GV.RM-01: Include LLM excessive agency in risk management
  strategy — document blast radius per deployment

**IDENTIFY**

- ID.AM-08: Inventory all LLM tool integrations — what
  each tool can do, what permissions it holds, what
  systems it can affect

**PROTECT**

- PR.AA-05: Implement least-privilege access for all LLM
  tool integrations — minimum permissions enforced,
  reviewed on change and quarterly
- PR.AA-01: Manage LLM service identities — unique identity
  per deployment, permissions scoped to defined role

**DETECT**

- DE.CM-01: Log and monitor all LLM tool invocations —
  anomalous scope, unusual parameters, or high frequency
  detected and alerted

**RESPOND**

- RS.MI-01: Contain excessive agency incidents — suspend
  agent, review all actions taken, reverse where possible

### LLM04 — Supply Chain

**Severity:** High

LLM applications depend on third-party model weights, datasets,
libraries, and plugins. CSF 2.0 GOVERN supply chain risk management
(GV.SC) is the primary category — supply chain is now a first-class
CSF concern.

The 2026 entry adds artifact provenance to this scope. A promoted
model, adapter, or converted artifact that is not what it claims to be —
unsigned weights, a hijacked conversion or merge service, or namespace reuse
on a model hub — is a supply-chain compromise even when every package
dependency is clean.

#### CSF 2.0 mapping

| Category | ID | Function | How it applies |
|---|---|---|---|
| Supply Chain Risk Management | GV.SC-01 | GOVERN | Cybersecurity supply chain risk management programme — LLM component vendors in scope |
| Supply Chain Risk Management | GV.SC-06 | GOVERN | Cybersecurity requirements included in contracts with suppliers — LLM model and data vendors |
| Asset Management | ID.AM-08 | IDENTIFY | Systems and hardware managed — ML SBOM as asset inventory for LLM components |
| Platform Security | PR.PS-02 | PROTECT | Software managed to reduce risk — LLM component vulnerability management and patching |

#### Mitigations by CSF function

**GOVERN**

- GV.SC-01: Establish cybersecurity supply chain risk management
  programme covering LLM components — model providers, dataset
  vendors, inference runtime suppliers
- GV.SC-06: Include security requirements in all LLM vendor
  contracts — provenance, integrity guarantees, vulnerability
  disclosure obligations, incident notification SLA

**IDENTIFY**

- ID.AM-08: Maintain ML SBOM as part of asset inventory —
  every LLM component (model, adapters, libraries) inventoried
  with version, source, and hash
- ID.RA-08: Receive threat intelligence about supply chain
  threats — subscribe to feeds covering ML component
  and model repository compromise

**PROTECT**

- PR.PS-02: Implement vulnerability management for all LLM
  components — scan SBOM against known CVEs, patch on schedule
- Pin all LLM component versions — no automatic updates
  without review and approval

**DETECT**

- DE.CM-09: Monitor for use of unauthorised software —
  alert on LLM component changes outside approved change
  management process

**RESPOND**

- RS.AN-03: Investigate supply chain incidents —
  determine which deployments are affected by a compromised
  LLM component

### LLM05 — Data and Model Poisoning

**Severity:** Critical

Adversaries corrupt training data or model weights with embedded
backdoors. CSF 2.0 data security (PR.DS), detection (DE.CM), and
incident analysis (RS.AN) address this.

The 2026 entry folds in fine-tuning subversion. A supplier LoRA
adapter, a customer fine-tune, or a distilled checkpoint can carry a backdoor
that no pre-training control catches, so poisoning defences must cover every
stage that writes weights, not just the original training corpus.

#### CSF 2.0 mapping

| Category | ID | Function | How it applies |
|---|---|---|---|
| Data Security | PR.DS-01 | PROTECT | Training data protected at rest — integrity verification, source allowlisting, provenance tracking |
| Continuous Monitoring | DE.CM-09 | DETECT | Monitoring for unauthorised software and configuration changes — model integrity verification at deployment |
| Risk Assessment | ID.RA-01 | IDENTIFY | Poisoning attack vectors identified and documented in risk assessment for each LLM deployment |
| Incident Analysis | RS.AN-03 | RESPOND | Root cause analysis for poisoning incidents — identify affected deployments, assess physical impact |

#### Mitigations by CSF function

**GOVERN**

- GV.SC-01: Apply supply chain controls to training data
  sources — same programme covering model weights extends
  to dataset vendors and data pipeline components

**IDENTIFY**

- ID.RA-01: Document poisoning attack vectors in risk
  assessment per LLM deployment — training data sources,
  fine-tuning pipeline, model weights, supply chain
- ID.AM-08: Maintain provenance records for all training
  data sources as part of asset management

**PROTECT**

- PR.DS-01: Implement training data integrity controls —
  hash-based provenance, source allowlisting, anomaly
  detection on data distributions before training runs
- Establish model rollback capability — approved clean
  checkpoint always available for revert

**DETECT**

- DE.CM-09: Verify model integrity at deployment —
  hash-based check against approved baseline before any
  production promotion
- DE.AE-02: Detect anomalous model output patterns —
  production monitoring for systematic recommendation
  drift indicating poisoning

**RESPOND**

- RS.AN-03: Investigate poisoning incidents — identify
  affected training runs, assess downstream deployments,
  determine physical or operational impact
- RS.MI-02: Remediate poisoning — rollback to clean
  checkpoint, quarantine affected data sources

### LLM06 — Unbounded Consumption

**Severity:** High

Adversarial inputs trigger disproportionate resource consumption.
CSF 2.0 infrastructure resilience (PR.IR) and risk management (GV.RM)
are the primary categories.

#### CSF 2.0 mapping

| Category | ID | Function | How it applies |
|---|---|---|---|
| Infrastructure Resilience | PR.IR-01 | PROTECT | Networks and environments protected to achieve resilience — rate limiting and resource controls as resilience measures |
| Continuous Monitoring | DE.CM-01 | DETECT | LLM resource consumption monitored — anomalous usage patterns detected and alerted |
| Incident Mitigation | RS.MI-01 | RESPOND | Incidents contained — automated rate limiting, circuit breakers, cost budgets as containment controls |
| Risk Management Strategy | GV.RM-01 | GOVERN | Risk management strategy established — LLM availability requirements and acceptable consumption risk defined |

#### Mitigations by CSF function

**GOVERN**

- GV.RM-01: Include LLM availability in risk management
  strategy — define acceptable consumption thresholds,
  cost budgets, and DoS risk tolerance

**PROTECT**

- PR.IR-01: Implement rate limiting and resource controls
  as resilience measures — hard token caps, per-user
  budgets, circuit breakers enforced at API gateway

**DETECT**

- DE.CM-01: Monitor LLM resource consumption in real time —
  anomalous consumption spikes detected and alerted

**RESPOND**

- RS.MI-01: Contain consumption incidents — automated rate
  tightening, session suspension, cost circuit breakers

**RECOVER**

### LLM07 — Misinformation

**Severity:** High

LLMs generate plausible but incorrect content. CSF 2.0 organisational
context (GV.OC) and awareness training (PR.AT) address this as a
governance and people risk, not only a technical risk.

#### CSF 2.0 mapping

| Category | ID | Function | How it applies |
|---|---|---|---|
| Organisational Context | GV.OC-01 | GOVERN | Acceptable use policy defines which LLM outputs require verification — high-stakes domains identified |
| Continuous Monitoring | DE.CM-09 | DETECT | Production monitoring for accuracy degradation — hallucination rates tracked per domain |
| Risk Assessment | ID.RA-01 | IDENTIFY | LLM misinformation risk assessed per use case — what decisions are influenced, what is the consequence |
| Awareness and Training | PR.AT-01 | PROTECT | Users trained on LLM output limitations — verification requirements for each use case |

#### Mitigations by CSF function

**GOVERN**

- GV.OC-01: Define accuracy requirements per LLM use case —
  which domains require human verification, which are
  acceptable for advisory use without verification

**IDENTIFY**

- ID.RA-01: Assess misinformation risk per deployment —
  what decisions are influenced by LLM output, what
  is the consequence of incorrect recommendations

**PROTECT**

- PR.AT-01: Train all users of LLM decision-support tools
  on output limitations — mandatory before access granted
- Deploy RAG grounded on authoritative, version-controlled
  sources — citations displayed alongside responses

### LLM08 — Hidden Context Exposure

**Severity:** High

Hidden context — the system prompt, developer instructions, retrieved
policy text, and the tool and function schemas an application assembles
into the model's context window — is extracted, inferred, or
reconstructed by adversaries.
CSF 2.0 data security (PR.DS) and access control
(PR.AA) are the primary categories.

The 2026 list broadens the former System Prompt Leakage entry to cover all
non-user-facing context, not just the system prompt. Severity tracks what
that context holds: internal rules and workflow logic are medium, embedded
credentials or reliance on context secrecy for authorisation are high, and
disclosure that chains to code execution or broad exfiltration is critical.
Design on the assumption that hidden context is discoverable, and never
treat it as a security boundary.

#### CSF 2.0 mapping

| Category | ID | Function | How it applies |
|---|---|---|---|
| Data Security | PR.DS-01 | PROTECT | System prompts classified as sensitive configuration and protected at rest — encrypted, access-controlled |
| Identity Management, Authentication & Access Control | PR.AA-05 | PROTECT | Access to system prompt storage restricted to authorised personnel — least privilege enforced |
| Continuous Monitoring | DE.CM-01 | DETECT | Access to system prompt storage logged and monitored — anomalous access detected |
| Risk Management Strategy | GV.RM-06 | GOVERN | Risk tolerance defined for system prompt exposure — operational security value of prompt confidentiality assessed |

#### Mitigations by CSF function

**GOVERN**

- GV.RM-06: Assess the security value of system prompt
  confidentiality per deployment — prompts containing
  operational details require higher protection level

**PROTECT**

- PR.DS-01: Encrypt system prompts at rest — not in cleartext
  configuration files, source code, or environment variables
- PR.AA-05: Restrict system prompt access to authorised
  personnel — version controlled, access logged

**DETECT**

- DE.CM-01: Monitor access to system prompt storage —
  alert on anomalous access patterns
- Conduct prompt extraction testing — verify resistance
  to known extraction techniques before deployment

**RESPOND**

- RS.AN-03: Investigate extraction incidents — assess
  what operational intelligence an attacker gained

### LLM09 — Vector and Embedding Weaknesses

**Severity:** Medium

Vector stores contain sensitive embeddings susceptible to adversarial
retrieval and inference attacks. CSF 2.0 data security (PR.DS) and
asset management (ID.AM) are the primary categories.

#### CSF 2.0 mapping

| Category | ID | Function | How it applies |
|---|---|---|---|
| Data Security | PR.DS-01 | PROTECT | Vector store content encrypted at rest — embeddings treated as sensitive derived data |
| Data Security | PR.DS-02 | PROTECT | Data in transit protected — vector store queries and results encrypted |
| Asset Management | ID.AM-08 | IDENTIFY | Vector stores inventoried as AI data assets — RBAC status, encryption status, CVE patching status |
| Continuous Monitoring | DE.CM-09 | DETECT | Monitoring for unauthorised software and anomalous access — vector store query anomalies detected |

#### Mitigations by CSF function

**IDENTIFY**

- ID.AM-08: Inventory all vector stores as AI data assets —
  document RBAC status, encryption status, content
  classification, and known CVE exposure

**PROTECT**

- PR.DS-01: Encrypt all vector store content at rest —
  same protection as source documents
- PR.AA-05: Enable RBAC on all vector stores —
  no unauthenticated access in any environment

**DETECT**

- DE.CM-09: Monitor vector store query patterns —
  bulk extraction, unusual query diversity detected
- Patch all vector database CVEs promptly —
  CVE-2024-3584 class as urgent findings

### LLM10 — Improper Output Handling

**Severity:** High

LLM output passed to downstream systems without validation enables
injection attacks. CSF 2.0 platform security (PR.PS) and data
security (PR.DS) are the primary PROTECT categories.

The 2026 entry renames Insecure Output Handling to Improper Output
Handling and widens it to cover the insecure code that coding assistants
generate at scale. Output that reaches a compiler, a repository, or a
production system carries the same downstream-execution risk as output that
reaches a shell, a browser, or a database.

#### CSF 2.0 mapping

| Category | ID | Function | How it applies |
|---|---|---|---|
| Platform Security | PR.PS-04 | PROTECT | Secure software development practices — output encoding and schema validation as platform security requirements |
| Data Security | PR.DS-02 | PROTECT | Data in transit protected — LLM output validated before passing to downstream systems |
| Continuous Monitoring | DE.CM-01 | DETECT | Networks and assets monitored — output injection patterns detected in LLM output channels |
| Risk Assessment | ID.RA-01 | IDENTIFY | Output injection documented as vulnerability class in risk assessment for all LLM integrations |

#### Mitigations by CSF function

**IDENTIFY**

- ID.RA-01: Document output injection as a vulnerability in
  all LLM integration risk assessments — cover XSS, SQL
  injection, command injection via model output

**PROTECT**

- PR.PS-04: Implement output encoding and schema validation
  as secure development requirements — treat LLM output as
  untrusted input to all downstream systems
- PR.DS-02: Validate all LLM outputs before they cross
  system boundaries — schema enforcement at API gateway

**DETECT**

- DE.CM-01: Monitor LLM output channels for injection patterns —
  automated detection of dangerous content in model responses

**RESPOND**

- RS.MI-01: Contain output injection incidents — block
  affected session, review downstream state changes

## CSF 2.0 profile for LLM security

The CSF 2.0 Organisational Profile framework allows organisations
to document current state vs target state per function. This
profile provides a starting point for LLM security programme alignment:

| CSF Function | LLM priority entries | Key categories | Target state |
|---|---|---|---|
| GOVERN | LLM04, LLM03, LLM07 | GV.SC-01, GV.OC-01, GV.RM-01/06 | Supply chain programme live, acceptable use policy published, risk register complete |
| IDENTIFY | LLM01, LLM02, LLM05 | ID.AM-08, ID.RA-01, ID.RA-08 | All LLM assets inventoried, risk assessments complete, threat intel subscriptions active |
| PROTECT | LLM01, LLM02, LLM03 | PR.DS-01/02, PR.AA-01/05, PR.PS-04 | Encryption, access controls, and secure development requirements implemented |
| DETECT | LLM05, LLM09, LLM06 | DE.CM-01/09, DE.AE-02 | Production monitoring live for all LLM systems, anomaly alerts operational |
| RESPOND | LLM01, LLM05, LLM06 | RS.AN-03, RS.MI-01/02 | Incident response procedures tested for all LLM-specific scenarios |

## Implementation priority

| Phase | LLM entries | CSF focus | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — GOVERN + IDENTIFY | LLM04, LLM03 | GV.SC-01, ID.AM-08 | Asset inventory and supply chain governance before technical controls |
| 2 — PROTECT | LLM01, LLM02, LLM10 | PR.DS, PR.AA, PR.PS-04 | Data protection and access control close the most common breach paths |
| 3 — DETECT | LLM05, LLM09, LLM06 | DE.CM-01/09 | Monitoring programme covers poisoning, vector store, and consumption risks |
| 4 — RESPOND + RECOVER | All | RS.AN, RS.MI, RC.RP | Incident response tested, BCP covers LLM availability |
